## About Me

I am a final-year IT undergraduate at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura hoping to participate in an internship. I am currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Business Information Systems (Special). I graduated from high school with the highest grade and rank. Currently, I am self-studying and freelancing using my skills (design, editing). I intend to pursue a career in software engineering, which I am currently preparing for (developing software projects). In the future, I hope to enter the real business world and give my full contribution to solving problems.
